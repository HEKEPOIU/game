Notes:

If you xbox controller trigger can only work one side please see this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/qer8pv/xbox_controller_right_and_left_trigger_merged/),
basically Microsoft change they driver that make controller trigger merge into one value,
I just can't solve this, but later when we support xinput it should be fix easily.
